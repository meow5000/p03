  <h3> CONTEXT </h3>
  <p>
For a film course, my team and I had to create a 5 minute film in around a month. We created a comedy film about a secret kpop fan who is despratley trying to go to a concert without his friends knowing. I was the designated video editor for our project and co producer and sound person.
</p>
  <br>

  <h3> ANALYSIS </h3>
  <p>I was apart of the ideation and beginning stages of the project such such as ideation and script writing. Because I was heavily involved in the script writing and ideation of the concept, I knew the whole story which would help me in post production. </p>
  <br>

  <p>I had worked closely with our director and cinemotagrapher to collab to know what their vision was for the shots and what they wanted me to edit in post-production.
 </p>

  <p>
I first organized the clips in respect to the storyboard and shot list.

  <br>
  <p>  I also had synced up the audio with the footage before cutting any of the footage
I then added transitions, cuts , and visual effects such as bokeh lights and text animation to enhance our story.

  <h3> CHALLENGES </h3>
  <p>  A problem I had run into was that given our time constraints, our actors schedueles only aligned on two days and this meant we would not have time to reshoot. We had missed a couple of our shots or the background of our shots were too noisy or some lights were in the shots when we did not want them to. To work around this, I had cropped our footage so it would be less noisy or I would keep the lights out of the shot by masking them. With shots missing, I had to use other shots or try to make the film flow without the shots we missed just by cutting some audio etc which turned out fine. With this, I learned that we should have considered the time constraints with what locations and people we knew we would be able to shoot with more so we would be more prepared and wouldn’t have to worry about not having time to reshoot and get all the shots we needed. </p>
  <br>

  <h3> EVALUATION </h3>
  <p>  With our film, we won audience’s choice award and received an A on this film and had the whole theatre laughing.</p>
  <br>

  <h3> REFLECTION </h3>
  <p> In conclusion, I learned about editing an actual film rather than a vlog or beauty video that I am used to editing stuff for social media. This was a different way of storytelling and I would say the ifrst time ive traditionally edited a video even though it was a comedy. I would defnitetly say I learned that knowing film theory and knowing compositions of shots definetly help my editing as I would also know what I am looking at and in addition to being apart of the script I would know how to convey stuff more through editing as I was apart of all the stages of the production.
