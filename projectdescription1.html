  <h3> CONTEXT </h3>
  <p> For the company OatMe Superfood, my team and I were tasked with creating with  social media campaigns that would help them spread brand awareness , spark engagement and educate their audience about the quality of their product in less than 2 months. I was the only design coordinator in our group of 4 and I was given free reign to create whatever I wanted with my expertise in graphic and motion design. I created one of the campaigns out of the four reels we have made for them.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h3> ANALYSIS </h3>
  <p> In the brainstorming phase, I collected inspiration and ended up proposing a 3D animated reel but evaluating the pros and cons I had to let them know it might be difficult due to time constraints. </p>
  <br>

  <p> Collaborating with the client further, we decided on any realistic deliverables aligned with content pillars. I decided to focus on highlight the product’s benefits as they had expressed their cconcern with people mistaking their product for candy. I had made a variation of concepts in Figma that were made to clear up any misconceptions by showcasing their nutritional labels. </p>
  <br>

  <br>

  <p> In one of our later meetings they had decided for me to start executing and finalizing one of my initial concepts based on their feedback. </p>
  <br>

  <p>  They had said they the design was too cute for their brand and that they would like me to showcase their products more in the video while also adhering to the styleguide of their website. </p>
  <br>

  </figure>

  <p>   With this feedback in mind, I had used the same colours on their website, font, structures and components. I had exported all these into individual. After sending the animation, they were happy with it but needed me to adjust the speed and I was able to do that quickly.</p>
  <br>

  <h3> CHALLENGES </h3>
  <p>  I encountered a significant challenge when I requested style and branding guidelines but received none except 5 colours. </p>
  <br>

  <br>

  <p> I was initially working with a limited color palette and had used their existing social media graphics as reference however feedback had indicated that the graphics appeared too cute. </p>
  <br>

  <br>

  <p> This led me to replicate their website's style by closely observing elements like fonts and colors. Ultimately, I learned to adapt and find creative solutions to maintain design consistency without formal guidelines. </p>

  <h3> EVALUATION </h3>
  <p>  The clients were happy to approve my reel and posted it as an ad on their Instagram page. In addition to the other three videos created by my team members, together we double dtheir following from 988 followers to 1828  followers from January to March 2024. </p>
  <br>

  <h3> REFLECTION </h3>
  <p>  In conclusion, this experience taught me valuable lessons in collaborating with real clients within a diverse team. As the sole designer, I learned the importance of effectively communicating design decisions to audiences with varying levels of design knowledge. Additionally, I gained insight into the significance of aligning my designs with my clients' visions, prioritizing their preferences over personal preferences.
